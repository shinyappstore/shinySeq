Shiny-Seq is a comprehensive application tool that comprises of carefully chosen statistical techniques and R-packages to carry out the various steps required to do down-stream differential expression analysis , and, integrating them to function as a coherent workflow with interactive, visualization, analysis and report generation capabilities. It is designed to act as an interface between the user and the pipeline by taking inputs from the user at each step of the pipeline and calling the appropriate modules in the pipeline for the purpose of exploratory and differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data.
